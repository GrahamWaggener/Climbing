Climbing Route Mapper

This code takes a CSV file of climbing route data downloaded from any selected location in Mountain Project and overlays the data on an interactive map using the longitude and lattitude. When a route is hovered over with the mouse, it will display the route name, rating, and the state in which the route is located. The location included in the CSV is too long and lists the state last, so the code will automatically trim the rest of the information and only include the state. The code can be useful to see relative locations of routes and plan trips to climb.
